 * This represents a script that is attached to a node in the editor.

 *      - Meshes
 *      - Lights
 *      - Cameas
 *      - Transform nodes
 * 
 * You can extend the desired class according to the node type.
 * Example:
 *      export default class MyMesh extends Mesh {
 *          public onUpdate(): void {
 *              this.rotation.y += 0.04;
 *          }
 *      }
 * The function "onInitialize" is called immediately after the constructor is called.
 * The functions "onStart" and "onUpdate" are called automatically.
